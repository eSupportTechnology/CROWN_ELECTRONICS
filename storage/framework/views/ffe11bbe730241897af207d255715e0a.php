                            <p>Welcome to crown.esupportsystem.shop, the online purchasing platform for Abans PLC (Sri Lanka).
                                The crown.esupportsystem.shop website provides services to its valued customers under the following
                                conditions. Please read and accept the under-mentioned conditions and guidelines
                                carefully before using the services of this website.</p>

                            <h3 class="title-terms">Product information at crown.esupportsystem.shop website</h3>
                            <p>The crown.esupportsystem.shop website attempts to be as accurate as possible with the information
                                displayed on the site. However, crown.esupportsystem.shop does not guarantee that product
                                descriptions or other content on this site are 100% accurate, complete, reliable or
                                completely free of errors. If a product offered by crown.esupportsystem.shop is not as described on
                                the website, a customer’s sole remedy is to return it in an unused condition within two
                                days of delivery. If there is any external damage to the package, a customer is
                                responsible for checking the item when it is handed over. An item will not be exchanged
                                for a refund or replacement if there is external damage e.g. packaging damage or dents.
                                Refunds or replacements will only apply for items with confirmed technical in-built
                                faults and are subjected to a fine or penalty for the cost. </p>

                            <p>In case the item received is found defective, customers should immediately inform
                                crown.esupportsystem.shop within 24 hours to arrange a replacement with a brand-new unit or a full
                                refund will be provided if the stock is unavailable. </p>

                            <p>Regarding the items sold through crown.esupportsystem.shop, the price of an item cannot be confirmed
                                until the customer orders the item. Even though every effort is made to provide accurate
                                pricing, there may be a negligible probability that some items can be mispriced. If the
                                new price is higher than the mentioned price, we will not cancel or deliver the item
                                without your confirmation about the new price, and all cancellations of items will be
                                informed prior. If the new price is higher and you still wish to purchase, you can pay
                                the additional amount but if you decide to cancel, we will issue a refund. </p>

                            <p>Due to current international exchange laws and conventions, even if delivery of the
                                selected item is canceled, crown.esupportsystem.shop cannot refund your money. You will, however, be
                                provided with credit on the website to purchase another available product up to the
                                value of the previous item.</p>

                                    unit with a higher capacity. crown.esupportsystem.shop will not be issuing refunds for these
                                    cases.</li>
